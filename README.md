International Journal of Innovative Technology and Exploring Engineering (IJITEE)Volume-8 Issue-12, October, 2019"](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Abdul-Gilal/publication/336650162_Towards_an_Improved_Strategy_for_Solving_Multi-_Armed_Bandit_Problem/links/5da9c275a6fdccc99d91461f/Towards-an-Improved-Strategy-for-Solving-Multi-Armed-Bandit-Problem.pdf)

`AI_Project_Rakhen_Semiu_1.ipynb` defines the Multi-armed Bandit Problem by implementing the basic slot machine experimentation. 

`AI_Project_Rakhen_Semiu_2.ipynb` implements Epsilon Greedy Strategy for the Multi-armed Bandit Problem.

`AI_Project_Rakhen_Semiu_3.ipynb` implements the Annealing Epsilon Greedy Strategy for the Multi-armed Bandit Problem.

`AI_Project_Rakhen_Semiu_4.ipynb` implements the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) in Greedy Epsilon for the Multi-armed Bandit Problem.
